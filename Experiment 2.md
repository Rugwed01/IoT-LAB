# üåê Basics of Networking Protocols & Cloud Platforms in IoT

This guide introduces two key networking protocols (**CoAP** and **MQTT**) and one popular cloud platform (**ThingSpeak**) used in IoT systems. These technologies are foundational in enabling communication and data processing between smart devices and the cloud.

## üì° Networking Protocols in IoT

---

### üîó 1. CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)

**Definition**:
CoAP is a lightweight, RESTful protocol designed for constrained devices and networks.

#### üßæ Key Features

| Feature        | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocol Type  | UDP-based (not TCP)                                           |
| Architecture   | Client‚ÄìServer (RESTful, similar to HTTP)                      |
| Communication  | Request/Response (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)                     |
| Reliability    | Supports Confirmable (CON) and Non-confirmable (NON) messages |
| Payload Format | Binary (CBOR/JSON)                                            |
| Port           | Default: UDP port **5683**                                    |

#### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Low overhead ‚Üí ideal for constrained devices
* Works well with lossy and low-bandwidth networks
* RESTful API ‚Üí simple and interoperable

#### üö´ Limitations

* Less mature ecosystem compared to MQTT
* Security and authentication need to be manually implemented (uses DTLS)

### üì© 2. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

**Definition**:
MQTT is a lightweight, publish/subscribe messaging protocol ideal for low-power, high-latency or unreliable networks.

#### üßæ Key Features

| Feature        | Description                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocol Type  | TCP-based                                                |
| Architecture   | **Publisher-Subscriber**, uses a central **Broker**      |
| Communication  | Asynchronous messaging                                   |
| QoS Levels     | 0 (At most once), 1 (At least once), 2 (Exactly once)    |
| Payload Format | JSON, text, binary                                       |
| Port           | Default: TCP port **1883** (unencrypted), **8883** (TLS) |

#### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Fast and lightweight
* Maintains connection state
* Supports QoS for reliable delivery
* Efficient for thousands of connected clients

#### üö´ Limitations

* Depends on a central broker
* Slightly heavier than CoAP in data packets
* Needs persistent connection (TCP)

### ‚òÅÔ∏è ThingSpeak

**Definition**:
ThingSpeak is an open-source IoT cloud platform by MathWorks that enables you to collect, visualize, and analyze sensor data in real time.

#### üßæ Key Features

| Feature        | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Ingestion | Uses HTTP, MQTT, or REST API                       |
| Data Storage   | Stores time-series sensor data in "Channels"       |
| Visualization  | Real-time graphs and dashboards                    |
| Integration    | MATLAB for advanced analytics and machine learning |
| Accessibility  | Free tier available (limited updates/hour)         |

#### üîß Core Components

| Component     | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Channel       | A virtual container for storing data fields                    |
| Field         | Each channel can have up to 8 data fields                      |
| Write API Key | Required to send (upload) data to ThingSpeak                   |
| Read API Key  | Required to retrieve (download) data from ThingSpeak           |
| MATLAB Code   | Built-in code editor for analytics & automated decision-making |

#### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Easy to use and beginner-friendly
* Free tier with public/private channels
* Built-in **MATLAB analytics**
